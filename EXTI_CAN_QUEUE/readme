kEY WORDS: ARM, FressRTOS, CAN, Interrupt, Queue.

This file is used for external interrupt and CAN bus interrupt in STM32 ARM RTOS.
The idea is when there is specific ID comes, the interruppt handler would write one value into the queue.
Another task with higher priority would transmit message to the bus. 
When press the key, it would printf some data to usart port.
And the external Interrupt comes from the KEYs.
