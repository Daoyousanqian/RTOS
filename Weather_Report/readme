The first module we need to use is ES2866 which is the Wifi chip.
Some commands for the module.
AT ï¼š test the presense, the response is OK
AT+ CWJAP = "SSID","PWD"
AT+CIPSTART="TCP","api.seniverse.com",80
AT+CIPMODE=1: in the mode you can see the data directly
AT+ CIPSEND: send the data

The API we used is "api.seniverse.com" and port is 80. 
In this case we get the data in JSON from the API. 

The command is: 
" GET https://api.seniverse.com/v3/weather/daily.json?
key=xxxxxx&location="city name"&language=xx&unit=c&start=0&days=x " 

We implement this case on STM32 with RTOS (realtime-operating system)
